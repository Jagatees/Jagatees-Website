            "Man in the Mirror" is an innovative virtual reality game developed
            for Google Cardboard, aimed at educating users about the effects of
            drugs. As part of a dynamic three-person team, my role was integral
            in refining and enhancing the project. My responsibilities included
            cleaning up the existing code, redesigning scenes, and ensuring the
            game's successful release on the store.
          </p>

            One of my notable contributions was the development of an
            interactive fish system within Unity, which added a unique element
            to the game. Additionally, I was responsible for creating new scenes
            that were featured in the game's trailer. These enhancements
            significantly contributed to the game's immersive experience.

            Our project was a collaborative effort with the Central Narcotics
            Bureau (CNB) of Singapore. Their involvement and support were
            crucial in bringing this educational VR experience to fruition. The
            partnership with CNB underscored the game's importance and relevance
            in today's societal context, particularly in addressing drug-related
            issues.

            The journey of working on "Man in the Mirror" was not only a
            testament to our team's technical abilities but also our commitment
            to creating meaningful, impactful digital experiences. The game's
            launch is a significant milestone in our endeavor to use technology
            for social good.
