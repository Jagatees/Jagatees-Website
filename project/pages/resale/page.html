            <strong>The Surge of HDB Resale Prices:</strong><br>
            In recent times, Singapore's HDB resale market has witnessed a dramatic upswing, with a record-breaking number of flats selling for over S$1 million. This trend has opened new avenues for property investment strategies.<br><br>
        
            <strong>Our Objective:</strong><br>
            Our team embarked on developing an AI-driven application to predict the future resale prices of HDB flats. Targeting homeowners and investors, this tool leverages data analytics and machine learning to forecast high-return investment opportunities in the HDB market.<br><br>
        
            <strong>Data-Driven Approach:</strong><br>
            We tapped into diverse datasets, including historical HDB resale data, current listings, and amenities information, sourced from various websites and platforms. Tools like BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium played a crucial role in efficient data crawling and extraction.<br><br>
        
            <strong>Innovative Solutions:</strong><br>
            Our project's core lies in its unique approach to data analysis. We introduced a weighted-map points system that evaluates potential resale values based on nearby amenities. This, coupled with advanced data visualization techniques like choropleth and scatter maps, empowers users with insightful predictions about profitable HDB units.<br><br>
        
            <strong>Learning and Growth:</strong><br>
            This journey was a rich learning experience for me and my team. We honed our skills in web scraping, data processing, and machine learning, overcoming challenges unique to each website's structure. As a team leader, coordinating and integrating diverse tasks was a rewarding challenge that enhanced my project management skills.<br><br>
        
            <strong>Reflections and Future Directions:</strong><br>
            While the current version of our application shows promise, we aim to further refine it by expanding our dataset and incorporating more property types. We're also exploring geospatial analysis enhancements to provide more nuanced insights.<br><br>
        
            <strong>Personal Takeaway:</strong><br>
            This project was more than just a technical endeavor; it was a journey of teamwork, skill enhancement, and innovation. As we look forward to improving our application, I am excited about the potential it holds for revolutionizing property investment strategies.<br><br>
