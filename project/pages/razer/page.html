              >My Journey with "Razer Con 2020": A Unity Project That Redefined
              My Skills</strong
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            Embarking on a project for a renowned company like Razer as an
            intern was a daunting yet exhilarating experience. The project,
            "Razer Con 2020," was not just another assignment; it was my debut
            into the world of professional game development, and I was the sole
            developer. This Unity-based project was a significant milestone in
            my career, and the journey was nothing short of extraordinary.
          </p>

          <p>
            The challenge was immense. I was tasked with integrating advanced
            technologies such as green screen functionality in Unity, using the
            HTC Vive Tracker for real-life camera integration into the virtual
            world, and working with the Twitch API among other technologies.
            Each of these tasks was a steep learning curve, but I was determined
            to rise to the occasion.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Overcoming Challenges and Achieving Milestones</strong></p>

          <p>
            The project's complexity was not just in its technical requirements
            but also in its scale. "Razer Con 2020" was designed to handle over
            one million users simultaneously, a feat that required meticulous
            planning and execution. Balancing performance and user experience
            was critical, and achieving this balance was one of my most
            significant accomplishments in the project.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Learning, Growing, and Succeeding</strong></p>

          <p>
            Despite being new to such a large-scale project and working under
            the pressure of high expectations, the experience was incredibly
            rewarding. I learned to use green screen technology in Unity,
            adapted real-life camera movements into the virtual environment
            using HTC Vive Tracker, and seamlessly integrated the Twitch API.
            The project pushed my boundaries, allowing me to explore new
            technologies and refine my problem-solving skills.

          </p>

          <p>
            The success of "Razer Con 2020" was a testament to the hard work and
            dedication I put into the project. It was not just about completing
            the tasks but also about exceeding expectations and delivering a
            product that could handle massive user traffic with ease. This
            project has been a significant stepping stone in my career, and I
            look forward to taking on more such challenging and exciting
            projects in the future.
